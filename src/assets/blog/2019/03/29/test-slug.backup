You're meant to have fun in life. In your world you can create anything you desire. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun

Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. Just beat the devil out of it. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it.

Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Anyone can paint. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world.

Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. Let's build an almighty mountain.

Play with the angles. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one.

Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Mountains are so simple, they're hard. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun.

We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. You can get away with a lot. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things.
